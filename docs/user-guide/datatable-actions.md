The **datatable actions** are the primary way to create new notifications and interact with existing notifications. The actions can be found directly above the datatable. *Some actions can be engaged immediately but others require selecting the checkbox(es) next to the notification(s) before they will become available:*

## New Notification
Create a new notification.

## Duplicate
Make an exact copy of one or more existing notifications.

## Simulate
Simulate triggering a notification to test its configuration. Only one notification can be simulated at a time.

## Bulk Edit
Edit the configuration of multiple notifications simultaneously. Only the **direction** and **external number** properties of the notifications are available for bulk editing.

## Delete
Permanently deletes one or more existing notifications. Consider toggling the **status** of a notification if it needs to be put into a temporarily inactive state versus permanent deletion.

## List/Grid View 

The datatable view icon ( ![List or Grid View](../assets/list-grid-view.svg "List or Grid View") ) toggles between list-style and card-style layout views. List view displays the traditional row and column layout and grid view displays a card layout.

## Filter
The filter icon ( ![Filter Icon](../assets/filter-icon.svg "Filter Icon") ) filters the data in the datatable. You can search by any keyword(s) or select from the preset filters for status and direction. Click the filter icon to open up the grey filter bar and then type a keyword to search or select one of the preset filters from the status or direction dropdowns.

## Export
The export icon ( ![Export Icon](../assets/export-icon.svg "Export Icon") ) will export all entries in the datatable to .xlsx file format. *Alternatively, you can select the checkbox(es) next to the notification(s) to export only the selected entries.*

## Toggle All
The toggle all switch toggles the status of *all* existing notifications. This feature is useful for updating or re-configuring multiple notifications without accidentally triggering them.
